These plugins provide seamless access to **Stack Overflow Teams'** most relevant data, allowing you to display the top users, top tags, and top questions directly within Backstage.

### OAuth Authentication for Secure Question Creation

## Demo Docker Image

If youâ€™d like to quickly see how this integration works without setting up your own Backstage instance, you can use my Docker image:

**`estoesmoises/stackoverflow-backstage-demo:latest`**

This image runs a Backstage instance pre-configured with the Stack Overflow for Teams plugin. You just need to pass a few environment variables when starting the container to connect it to your Stack Overflow for Teams instance.
